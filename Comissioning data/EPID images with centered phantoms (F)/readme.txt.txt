data for F acquired on the CL6 of the Kingston General Hospital on June 28 2017 by Stefano Peca and Zach Whatman

Imager vert was -50 cm

First we performed a new dark field (MDF01347.dcm) and flood field (MFF01348.dcm) corrections, with a 21x28 field and with 20 cm of solid water in the beam, centered vertically.
Resolution was set at half (512x384)

each acquisition of 100 MU produced approx 78 cine images. frames/image parameter was set to 1.

All is 6 MV, 400 MU/min

w is total phantom thickness (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40). phantoms were always vertically cenetered (i.e. w=20 phantom had SSD=90, depth of isocentre=10)

l is square field size (5, 10, 15, 20).

all units cm
