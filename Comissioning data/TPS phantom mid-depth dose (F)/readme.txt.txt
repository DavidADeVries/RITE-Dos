w is phantom thickness, l is square field size.

The dose map is taken at phantom mid depth, which was also at the depth of isocenter.
i.e. "w20l10" is a 10x10 applied to a phantom 20 cm thick (HU set to 0). The dose map comes from depth 10. SSD was 90.

The dose calc algorithm was AAA 13623 and was specific for the unit "CL6" which is an older Varian Clinac

Total number of fractions was set to 1. MU was set to 100.

6 MV, 400 MU/min
